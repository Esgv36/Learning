      <div id="tribute-info"><p>Boy oh boy where do I even begin. Kanye‚Ä¶ honey, my pookie bear. I have loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you. The way you drive into the concerts and shake the audience. Your silky smooth touch to every melody, and that gorgeous sampling. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you retire.</p>
      
      <p> You had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. You are even amazing off the music world, you're a great husband and father, sometimes I even call you dad. I forvever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face. You have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when you first started decending onto madness and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when dropped Ye, because it was amazing. I Just wanted you to be back to your prime. </p>
      
      <p>Not only have you changed the music industry and the world forever, but you've eternally changed my world. And now you're getting older, but still the goat, my goat. I love you pookie bear, my glorious king, Kanye West. ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏èü´∂üèΩ</p></div>
